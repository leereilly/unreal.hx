  WARNING: This type was defined as MinimalAPI on its declaration. Because of that, its properties/methods are inaccessible
  
  Fixme: this is still incomplete and probablyh not what most games want for melee systems.
          -Only actually activates on Blocking hits
          -Uses first PrimitiveComponent instead of being able to specify arbitrary component.
