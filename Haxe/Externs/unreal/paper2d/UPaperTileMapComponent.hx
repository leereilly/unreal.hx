/**
  A component that handles rendering and collision for a single instance of a UPaperTileMap asset.
  
  This component is created when you drag a tile map asset from the content browser into a Blueprint, or
  contained inside of the actor created when you drag one into the level.
  
  NOTE: This is an early access preview class.  While not considered production-ready, it is a step beyond
  'experimental' and is being provided as a preview of things to come:
   - We will try to provide forward-compatibility for content you create.
   - The classes may change significantly in the future.
   - The code is in an early state and may not meet the desired polish / quality bar.
   - There is probably no documentation or example content yet.
   - They will be promoted out of 'Early Access' when they are production ready.
