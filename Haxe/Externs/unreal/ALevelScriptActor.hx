  ALevelScriptActor is the base class for classes generated by
  ULevelScriptBlueprints. ALevelScriptActor instances are hidden actors that
  exist within a level, and can execute level-wide logic (operating on specific
  actor instances within the level). The level-script's functionality is defined
  inside the ULevelScriptBlueprint itself (using the blueprint's node-based
  interface).
