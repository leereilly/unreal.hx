  Implement an Actor component for input bindings.
  
  An Input Component is a transient component that is to an Actor to bind various forms of input events to delegate functions.
  Input components are processed from a stack managed by the PlayerController and processed by the PlayerInput.
  Each binding can consume the input event preventing other components on the input stack from processing the input.
