/**
  This class acts as a base class for a save game object that can be used to save state about the game.
  When you create your own save game subclass, you would add member variables for the information that you want to save.
  Then when you want to save a game, create an instance of this object using CreateSaveGameObject, fill in the data, and use SaveGameToSlot, providing a slot name.
  To load the game you then just use LoadGameFromSlot, and read the data from the resulting object.
