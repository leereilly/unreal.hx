  A DamageType is intended to define and describe a particular form of damage and to provide an avenue

  For example, a game could make a DamageType_Fire set it up to ignite the damaged actor.
  
  DamageTypes are never instanced and should be treated as immutable data holders with static code
  functionality.  They should never be stateful.
