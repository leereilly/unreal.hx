  PhysicsAsset contains a set of rigid bodies and constraints that make up a single ragdoll.
  The asset is not limited to human ragdolls, and can be used for any physical simulation using bodies and constraints.
  A SkeletalMesh has a single PhysicsAsset, which allows for easily turning ragdoll physics on or off for many SkeletalMeshComponents
  The asset can be configured inside the Physics Asset Editor (PhAT).
